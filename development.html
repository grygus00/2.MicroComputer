                <h2>ZX81</h2>
                <p>One of the most well known micro computers was the <strong>ZX81</strong>, which came out in 1981.
                    This computer had a
                    wide appeal even though it had no more than 1 Kb of RAM. Later extension modules became
                    available,
                    so that you could upgrade to either 16 or 64 Kb. With so much RAM you could type in 64.000
                    characters of computer code.

                    The ZX81 was followed by the ZX Spectrum in 1982. This one came with 16 Kb but could be upgraded
                    to
                    128 Kb. In order to use it, one would have to connect it to a television set and the resolution
                    you’d see would be 256 x 192 pixels which equals to 32 characters across in 24 lines.

                    The computer was able to show 8 colours and play five octaves of sound in mono.

                <h2>MORE BRANDS</h2>
                <p>Within the next couple of years a myriad of micro computers hit the marked. They were now
                    becoming
                    known as home computers and they include machines from well known brands like
                    <cite>Acorn</cite>,
                    <cite>Amstrad</cite>, <cite>Atari</cite>,
                    <cite>Commodore</cite>, <cite>Texas</cite> and <cite>Sinclair</cite>.
                    <br> <br>
                    Two brands ended up stealing the scene - and the market: <strong><cite>IBM</cite></strong> and
                    <strong><cite>Apple</cite></strong>.
