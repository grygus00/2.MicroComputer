                <p class="header_p">The most successful micro computer by far was <strong>the Commodore 64</strong>. It
                    had an 8 bit
                    micro processer with a clock frequency at just about 1 megahertz and 64 Kb of <abbr

                <h2>Commodore 64</h2>
                <p>The really extraordinary thing about the <abbr title="Commodore 64">C64</abbr> though was it’s extra
                    graphics chip which was able to
                    show 16 colours, 8 sprites, had scrolling capabilities and a resolution of 320x200 pixels (40x25
                    characters) and it’s sound chip that could play 8 octaves of sound in 3 channels. The multimedia
                    race had begun (although no one used that word yet).

                    The C64 was a keyboard with the computer inside, like most other home computers. It did have several
                    connections on the back through witch you could connect other types of hardware like joysticks, midi
                    instruments an external storage device and a television set.

                <h3>Gaming Machine</h3>
                <p>The C64 was a plug-and-play (no one used that word either). When you turned it on, the curser was
                    immediately blinking ready to take commands. The interface was text based and the programming
                    language was Commodore Basic. Anything you wrote would be executed straight away unless you put it
                    into a program. You created programs by adding line numbers in front of your command. This program
                    was written line by line (not necessarily in the right order) and stored in the computers RAM. If
                    you turned the computer off, your work would be lost unless you had stored it on an external storage
                    device.

                <h2>command line</h2>
                <p>When the program was ready you could run it by typing the command RUN followed by tapping the Return
                    key.

                    Disk drives were for the most part too expensive and a special cassette drive were used as a data
                    storage device.

                <h3>Commands</h3>
                <p>So in order to open up a program on a Commodore 64, one would have to write directly to the screen
                    (which was effectively a prompt or a terminal)
                    <br>
                    : LOAD “PROGRAM_NAME”,8. The number would be the device to connect with.
                    <br>
                    The Commodore would respond with the following lines:
                    <br>
                    SEARCHING FOR “PROGRAM_NAME”
                    <br>
                    LOADING
                    <br>
                    READY.
                    <br>
                    The program would now be loaded into the Commodore’s memory. You could have a look at the program by
                    writing the command LIST or you could start the execution of the program with RUN.
