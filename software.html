                <h2>Software history</h2>
                <p>In the time of the micro computer software were written specifically for each computer, as they all
                    came with their own operating system build into them. Burned into their microchips where the
                    commands that they understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the specific
                    machine. The amount of software available for a specific computer played a significant role in it’s
                    success.
                    <br><br>
                    This is one of the reasons for the huge success of <cite>the Commodore 64</cite>. With it’s powerful
                    graphics and
                    sound processors it was a perfect platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to
                    developed all sorts.

                <p>A contester to the micro computer was <abbr title="International Business Machines ">IBM’s</abbr>
                    so-called Personal Computer or PC although is was much
                    pricier and did not find it’s way into normal homes straight away. was a much began to change as the
                    new IBM PC (PC for Personal Computer) entered the market. The IBM PC used a software operating
                    system. This had to load on startup, but made it easier to update - simply because you did not need
                    to buy a completely new piece of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was
                    short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in their name in the early days).
                    The code was based on the UNIX operating system although greatly simplified.

                <h3>From calculators to communication devices</h3>
                <p>Computers continued to develop. In the micro computer age the computer were mostly used as a very
                    specialized machine. In many cases it was a toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming.
                    Later that changed, as the internet developed and people began to connect. In the words of Bill
                    Gates, the founder of Microsoft and the developer of MSDOS: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    I think it's fair to say that personal
                    computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of communication,
                    they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.
